Vagrant Testing
========================

Quickstart
------------------------

Here is a one-liner to set your ``project_name``, delete any existing vagrant VM, rebuild it and
deploy our code to it. It takes about 20-30 minutes on my box. See below for further explanations on
what these commands do::

  sed -i 's/project_name: example/project_name: hacker_news_scraper/g' conf/pillar/project.sls && \
    vagrant destroy && \
    vagrant up && \
    fab vagrant setup_master && \
    fab vagrant setup_minion:salt-master,db-master,cache,web,balancer -H 33.33.33.10 && \
    fab vagrant deploy

Starting the VM
------------------------

You can test the provisioning/deployment using `Vagrant <http://vagrantup.com/>`_. This requires
Vagrant 1.8.7+ and VirtualBox (``apt-get install virtualbox``). The box will be installed if you
don't have it already.::

    vagrant up

The general provision workflow is the same as in the previous :doc:`provisioning guide <provisioning>`
so here are notes of the Vagrant specifics.


Provisioning the VM
------------------------

The only variable that absolutely must be set is ``project_name`` in ``conf/pillar/project.sls``.
This should be set to ``hacker_news_scraper``. Set other environment variables and secrets in
``conf/pillar/local.sls``. It is OK for this to be checked into version control because it can only
be used on the developer's local machine. To finalize the provisioning run::

    fab vagrant setup_master
    fab vagrant setup_minion:salt-master,db-master,cache,web,balancer -H 33.33.33.10
    fab vagrant deploy

The above command will setup Vagrant to run the full stack. If you want to test only a subset
of the roles you can remove the unneeded roles. If you want to test the Celery setup then you
can also add the ``queue`` and ``worker`` roles to the list.

The Vagrant box will use the current working copy of the project and the local.py settings. If you
want to use this for development/testing it is helpful to change your local settings to extend from
staging instead of dev::

    # Example local.py
    from hacker_news_scraper.settings.staging import *

    # Override settings here
    DATABASES['default']['NAME'] = 'hacker_news_scraper_local'
    DATABASES['default']['USER'] = 'hacker_news_scraper_local'

    DEBUG = True

This won't have the same nice features of the development server such as auto-reloading but it will
run with a stack which is much closer to the production environment. Also beware that while
``conf/pillar/local.sls`` is checked into version control, ``local.py`` generally isn't, so it will
be up to you to keep them in sync.


Testing on the VM
------------------------

With the VM fully provisioned and deployed, you can access the VM at the IP address specified in the
``Vagrantfile``, which is 33.33.33.10 by default. Since the Nginx configuration will only listen for the domain name in
``conf/pillar/local.sls``, you will need to modify your ``/etc/hosts`` configuration to view it
at one of those IP addresses. I recommend 33.33.33.10, otherwise the ports in the localhost URL cause
the CSRF middleware to complain ``REASON_BAD_REFERER`` when testing over SSL. You also need to
assign the name ``ubuntu`` to that IP address, since our fabfile uses that hostname to connect, when
running management commands. You will need to add::

    33.33.33.10 <domain> ubuntu

where ``<domain>`` matches the domain in ``conf/pillar/local.sls``. For example, let's use
dev.example.com::

    33.33.33.10 dev.example.com ubuntu

In your browser you can now view https://dev.example.com and see the VM running the full web stack.

Note that this ``/etc/hosts`` entry will prevent you from accessing the true dev.example.com.
When your testing is complete, you should remove or comment out this entry.
